This is an app for my intern application. 

How I did this: ChatGPT, and some basic knowledge of web development lmao. 

Time spent: ~6 hours. 

Functions include: 

1. CRUD (Create, read/view, update/edit, and delete) objects within a SQL database.
2. Weather query from http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
3. File export (.csv, .json and .pdf)

Was doing some other projects at the time so sadly it is not perfect.
